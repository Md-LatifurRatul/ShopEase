## State Management

ShopEase uses [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for scalable state management:

- **ProductProvider:** Handles product list, details, and updates.
- **OrderProvider:** Manages order placement, retrieval, and updates.
- **BannerProvider:** Controls banners and marketing content.
- **Usage:** Providers are initialized via `MultiProvider` in `main.dart` for easy access throughout the app.
